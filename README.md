# React-Native Redux Boilerplate

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mCodex/react-native-redux-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a simple `react-native init` project with some libraries that I just installed myself and I use it on many projects as my "RN starter kit". This project includes out of the box:

* React-Native
* React-Native-Navigation
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* Redux Offline
* ESlint
* Airbnb's ESlint rules


## Installation

Clone repo and run:

```
yarn
cd ios/ && pod install
cd .. && yarn start
```

## Description

Starting a new project can be take some time to configure project structure, libraries and so on... So, I decided to make this starter kit open-source for anyone who needs a little help.
